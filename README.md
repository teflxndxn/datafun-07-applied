## Project Purpose
This project is focused on applying machine learning techniques, including linear regression, using Jupyter notebooks and Python libraries.

## Virtual Environment Setup

To keep dependencies organized, this project uses a local Python virtual environment.

### Steps to Create and Activate the Virtual Environment

1. Create the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv

2. Activate the virtual environment:
On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

On Windows (PowerShell):
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

3. Upgrade pip and install required packages:

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python3 -m pip install jupyterlab numpy pandas pyarrow matplotlib seaborn scipy

## Running the Project
After activating the virtual environment, launch JupyterLab by running:jupyter lab

## Git Workflow Commands

git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup with virtual environment and dependencies"
git push -u origin main
